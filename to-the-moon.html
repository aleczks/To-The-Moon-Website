                  Ground Control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your helmet <br>
                  on. Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six). <br>
                  Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three). Check ignition <br>
                  and may God's love be with you (two, one, liftoff). This is Ground Control <br>
                  to Major Tom. <br>
                    <br>
                  You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose shirts <br>
                  you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. This is Major Tom <br>
                  to Ground Control. I'm stepping through the door. <br>
